Chef is happy only if three conditions hold:

Chef finished cooking a delicious meal
Chef got AC for a programming problem with an almost correct code
Chef got a new problem with a sequence of integers
Today, all three conditions are satisfied. Chef would like you to feel his happiness and
provide him with a solution for this new problem with a sequence of integers. The problem is as follows.

You are given a sequence A1,A2,…,AN. You need to determine if it is possible to choose two indices i and j 
such that Ai≠Aj, but AAi = AAj. (If it was possible, Chef would be truly happy.)
