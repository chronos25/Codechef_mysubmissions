# ABOUT CODECHEF

CodeChef - A Platform for Aspiring Programmers
https://www.codechef.com/

CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms,
computer programming and programming contests. At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a programming contest 
at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions 
and discussions related to algorithms, binary search, technicalities like array size and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for 
programming competitions,CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of 
computer programming.
